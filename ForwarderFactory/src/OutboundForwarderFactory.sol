/**
 * @title OutboundForwarderFactory
 * @notice Deterministically deploys a OutboundForwarder (BeaconProxy) from (sender, destinationDomain, mintRecipient).
 *         The BeaconProxy is deployed with empty constructor data, so its initCodeHash is a constant that depends
 *         only on the beacon address, and the predicted address becomes f(deployer, salt) → the address stays the
 *         same even when the forwarder logic changes.
 * @dev Two-layer upgrade: the factory itself is UUPS, the deployed OutboundForwarders use a Beacon (upgraded in bulk by
 *      swapping the impl). The shared CREATE2/beacon machinery lives in ForwarderFactoryBase; this contract only
 *      builds the typed salt preimage, encodes the per-route initialize, and owns its errors/events.
